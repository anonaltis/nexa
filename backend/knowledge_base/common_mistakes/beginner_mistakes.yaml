# Common Beginner Mistakes in Electronics
# Used for proactive warnings and teaching moments

led:
  mistakes:
    - mistake: "Forgetting current limiting resistor"
      consequence: "LED burns out instantly"
      severity: "critical"
      explanation: "LEDs have very low internal resistance. Without a resistor, current is only limited by power supply, which is typically far more than LED can handle."
      fix: "Always calculate resistor: R = (Vs - Vf) / If"
      example: "For 5V, red LED (1.8V), 15mA: R = (5-1.8)/0.015 = 213Ω, use 220Ω"

    - mistake: "Reversing LED polarity"
      consequence: "LED won't light (usually no damage)"
      severity: "low"
      explanation: "LEDs are diodes - they only conduct in one direction."
      fix: "Longer leg = anode (+), shorter leg/flat side = cathode (-)"
      tip: "Remember: L-ong leg goes to L-ive (positive)"
